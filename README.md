Alphorn is an open source notification router. Point any service that can send a webhook at Alphorn, and it will fan the message out to Slack, Discord, Telegram, Email, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, and multiple other destinations — with filtering, retries, rate limits, and delivery history built in.

Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to commercial notification hubs, built on a boring, scalable stack (PostgreSQL + Next.js + pg-boss) that you can run yourself.

## Features

- **20+ delivery channels** — Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, Mattermost, Rocket.Chat, Google Chat, Zulip, Matrix, ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Twilio SMS, Vonage SMS, SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun, generic Webhook, SSE, and more.
- **Powerful filter DSL** — route messages by priority, tags, title, body, or payload fields. Regex supported (safely).
- **Reliable delivery** — pg-boss queue with retries (5 attempts, exponential backoff), permanent vs. transient error handling, 7-day job retention.
- **Real-time streaming** — SSE endpoint for live event feeds. Dedicated SSE server for horizontally scaled deployments.
- **Multi-tenant** — Better Auth with organizations, invitations, roles, and two-factor (TOTP).
- **Optional billing** — Paddle integration with plan gating if you want to run Alphorn as a service.
- **Horizontally scalable** — stateless web, standalone workers, shared Postgres + S3-compatible storage. No local state.
- **Observable** — structured Pino logs and Sentry integration out of the box.
- **Self-hostable first** — one `docker compose up` away. No cloud lock-in, no mandatory external services.

## Quick start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphorn-dev/alphorn.git
cd alphorn
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and create your first account.

### Local development

Requirements: Node.js 20.9+, pnpm, PostgreSQL 18.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:deploy
pnpm dev
```

optional: you can run one or multiple workers via:

```bash
pnpm dev:worker

# or build and run worker with defined concurrency
# pnpm build:worker && WORKER_CONCURRENCY=50 node --env-file=.env worker.mjs
```

```

- **`src/proxy.ts`** — auth routing.
- **`src/channels/`** — plugin registry. Each channel is a `ChannelHandler` with a Zod config schema and `send()` method.
- **`src/worker/`** — pg-boss-backed delivery worker. Runs embedded (`MODE=all`) or standalone (`MODE=worker`).
- **`src/lib/filter/`** — Zod discriminated-union filter DSL with safe regex.
- **`src/lib/sse/`** — in-memory SSE registry. For multi-instance deployments, use the standalone `pnpm sse-server`.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the full architecture and conventions reference.

## Runtime modes

`MODE` environment variable controls what each process runs:

| Mode            | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `all` (default) | Web server + embedded worker. Good for single-instance deployments.      |
| `web`           | Web server only. Use when running workers separately.                    |
| `worker`        | Standalone delivery worker. Scale horizontally behind a shared Postgres. |

For horizontally scaled SSE, run `pnpm sse-server` with `SSE_MODE=standalone` and a shared `SSE_INTERNAL_SECRET`.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` — it is the source of truth and documents every option, including optional integrations (OAuth, SMTP, Sentry, S3).

**Minimum required:**

| Variable             | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | PostgreSQL connection string                            |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Random secret — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`    | Public URL of your instance                             |

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test             # all tests
pnpm test:unit        # pure logic
pnpm test:integration # hits a real Postgres
```

Unit tests cover the filter DSL, billing math, and channel config parsing. Integration tests exercise Prisma, pg-boss, and route handlers against a real database.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before opening a PR:

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — it documents the stack, conventions, and design principles.
2. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test`.
3. Keep changes focused; new business logic (channels, filters, billing, routing) should come with tests.

For new channels, implement the `ChannelHandler` interface in `src/channels/` and register it in `registry.ts`. Throw on failure so pg-boss can retry — distinguish permanent vs. transient errors.
